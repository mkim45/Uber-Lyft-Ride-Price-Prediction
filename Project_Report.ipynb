    "abstract: _For this project, we wanted to build a model that predicts Uber/Lyft prices and identifies which ride and/or weather factors contribute most to pricing. We wanted to optimize RMSE, as we wanted to penalize large errors since having a bad estimate could cause someone to go over their budget, which could have serious consequences. Distance was the largest predictor of price, which makes intuitive sense. However, our final model also used the following predictors, like SUV, distance, product shared, cab_type, productXL, product lux, pressure, and log_distance, which we discovered were useful through extensive EDA, as shown in our project reports. Our model’s RMSE was $2.69, with a RSE of $3.06. Our final recommendations/findings are as follows, 1) Uber and Lyft riders should understand that longer distance rides and the type of ride they take (product type) are most important when it comes to determining the price of the ride and 2) Uber/Lyft drivers and taxi drivers should be aware that time of day and source/destination had little to no impact on price of Uber/Lyft rides – there are other, better factors that affect demand and pricing_.\n",

    "For this project, we wanted to undestand how certain ride factors (ex. distance of the trip, timestamp, weather, destination, etc.) relate to the price of a ride. Since our response variable (price of the ride) is continuous, this is a regression problem. Our project incoprorated both prediction and inference. One the one hand, we wanted to be able to build a model to predict the price of rides. In addition, we wanted to figure out which factors had the largest impact on price, which has to do with inference.  "

    "As can be seen by the distributions charts, the only missing values in the weather data set were for rain and the only missing values for the rides data set were for price. We began our cleaning by filling each missing value of rain to be 0. We discovered that there were no data points in the original weather dataset that were 0 and assumed that when there was no rain, no value was reported. Thus, we imputed 0 for all missing values of rain. We then merged the weather and rides datasets to allow us to use weather when predicting price. After doing so, we droped all observations with missing values for price. Since we are predicting price, we need prices for all rides that are used to train our model. \n",

    "Unfortunately, after merging both data sets and dropping observations with no price, we had lost about 690,000 observations. Although this is a significant amount of data lost, our main purpose was to improve upon past prediction models. We wanted to test whether including weather would improve the model's accuracy in predicting price or not. Additionally, because this data was taken over a 1.5 week span, we felt that the 3000 data points left in the data set could still be representative of rides for this time period. "

    "The model that we used was an initial single linear regression model, several multiple linear regression models, and finally a final multiple linear regression model using forward stepwise selection. We decided to optimize for the performance metric of RMSE. We did this because we wanted to penalize large errors, since large errors could mean that the customer ends up paying a much higher price than they were expecting if using our model to try and predict the ride price (which could be an undue, large financial strain for them). Therefore, since RMSE properly penalizes these large errors versus other options like MAE (which equally penalizes the error from each observation), we will proceed with utilizing this performance metric to optimize. \n",

    "There was nothing too unorthodox or new in our approach. We decided to start with a base/naive model with what we thought would be the singlemost important predictor (distance), and then we moved onto using all of the predictors in the dataset and the new predictor variables that we created to get new multiple linear regression models. Lastly, we used forward stepwise selection to get a multiple linear regression model considering all of the previously used predictor variables and all possible two-factor interactions as potential predictors. We decided to use forward stepwise selection because doing so could be used for variable selection and was more computationally feasible than best subset selection given our 171 predictors (incredibly large number of predictors). Further, since we start with the null model of only the intercept and gradually add predictor variables one at a time, we prefered this to backward stepwise selection since the larger number of predictors allows us to identify important ones without including irrelevant ones. We made two final models, one that was best for inference with VIF values that did not indicate problematic amounts of multicollinearity, and one for prediction.\n",

    "We anticipated problems when it came to preparing the actual data that allowed us to go about our approach. Specifically, there was only select weather data available for various source and destination locations on specific dates and at specific times. As such, we did in fact encounter this problem when approaching how to best clean and prepare the data itself before going about developing our models. Additionally, we anticipated the problem of multicollinearity when it came to the dummy variables we were going to create on the type of ride and with weather variables. Because of this, we made sure to look at VIF values when it came to our final multiple linear regression model with a unique model just for inference and one for prediction. Lastly, we wanted to potentially focus on autocorrelation as a possible problem we anticipated and wanted to explore in our data further. The first model that we tried including our created variables and the weather variables did not have a large improvement compared with the base/naive model of all the ride dataset variables. \n",

    "Our problem did already have some solutions posted on Kaggle trying to predict the ride price of Uber/Lyft rides in the same datasets. The solution[1] that we did look at closer decided to approach the problem we encountered with data cleaning/preparation of the weather variables by averaging them out for each source and destination location. After further analysis, we decided that this wouldn't be the best approach, since the average rainfall, cloud coverage, etc. of a given location isn't what we wanted to examine as predictors. Instead, we wanted accurate weather information of an actual given time for a location, which is why we took the steps we did to clean the data and get only the observations that had said weather data for locations at specific times. Further, this solution did not handle the potential issues with multicollinearity or exploration of autocorrelation, which we decided to analyze to build upon this solution. While this model only ended up analyzing R-squared as a performance metric, we do believe that our model was better compared to this solution. Although we cannot compare by RMSE, the solution's model does little to build upon the multiple linear regression model RMSE with all the train and weather predictor variables, and as such, we believe that our final regression model does in fact do better when compared to this solution. Additionally, since this solution's model does not handle the possibility of multicollinearity, we believe that our final model is better since we have confirmed that no problematic amounts of multicollinearity exist.

    "The base model was created as a single linear regression model using distance as the only predictor variable and price as the response variable. The resulting RMSE for test data of the model was approximately 8.67 USD. The mean for the price of the cleaned data observations was approximately 16.32 USD and the standard error was approximately 9.22 USD. We decided to make a better base model as a multiple linear regression model using all of the variables from the ride dataset as predictor variables (including distance, source, destination, name, product_id, and cab_type but not surge_multiplier, since this would not be known by the stakeholders at the time of the prediction). We made this decision because we felt that it would be a better representation of comparison for our efforts in improving the base model. The resulting RMSE for test data of the better initial model was approximately 3.06 USD. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this, we examined the predictor variables for potential variable transformations that would be helpful in improving model performance as measured by RMSE for test data. Ultimately, we discovered one possible non-linear relationship between distance and price from a barplot of price against binned distance (with the price increasing slightly more as binned distance increased) that was shown in our code report. As such, we decided it would be prudent to examine whether a log(distance) transformation would improve RMSE if included in a model (which it ended up doing) because of the possible non-linear relationship between price and distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we decided to examine whether this base multiple linear regression model also violated any modeling assumptions. Specifically, we did so by plotting residuals against fitted values. While this base model did mostly seem to not violate the linearity assumption, there did seem to be a problematic trend as the fitted values increased that residuals tended to stray away from the line of residuals = 0 that could mean it violated the constant variance assumption. As such, we then thought that it would be a good next step to use log(price) as our response variable in the next model we developed. Since this log transformation of price will result in a higher shrinkage of larger values, to some extent we were hoping that this would resolve this issue. \n",

    "We then went about approaching 2-factor interactions and variable selection by creating a final multiple linear regression model for prediction through forward stepwise selection. We decided to use forward stepwise selection because doing so could be used for variable selection and was more computationally feasible than best subset selection given our 171 predictors (incredibly large number of predictors). Further, since we start with the null model of only the intercept and gradually add predictor variables one at a time, we prefered this to backward stepwise selection since the larger number of predictors allows us to identify important ones without including irrelevant ones. We made two final models, one that was best for inference with VIF values that did not indicate problematic amounts of multicollinearity, and one for prediction. For the model used for prediction, we got a final RMSE of 2.69 USD for test data, which was an improvement from our base model.\n",

    "We decided to explore whether the presence of outliers and influential points could impact the performance of our lasso regression model. We examined this both in large dataset with 690,000 observations and the smaller dataset of about 3000 observations to ensure a thorough analysis of influential points. We started by identifying outlying observations by looking at the studentized residuals. The larger dataset, however, was too large for this code to run so we used standardized residuals which is the next best option. Since our model is mainly concerned with prediction and outliers impact inference, we didn't read too much into the outlying observations for each dataset. We then got the leverage for each point and classified an observation as high leverage if it was greater than 4 times the average leverage. Applying this to each dataset, we found that the smaller dataset had 0 high leverage points. This means that there would be no influential points either, so there were no possible improvements to be made for the model using the smaller dataset. The larger dataset did ultimately have high leverage points, and influential points as well. However, when these were removed, there was no effect on the model RMSE, so there was no benefit to prediction in removing influential points. Ultimately, our analysis of influential points determined that they did not have a significant impact on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We examined the possible problem of overfitting in this final linear regression model that we developed. We used RSE as a test of whether the final regression model was in fact overfitting. From our calculations, we found that the RSE was 3.06 USD. Compared with the RMSE value for the model for test data of 2.69 USD, the RSE was comparable with that of the RMSE. As such, it means that we can conclude from interpreting these results that the final linear regression model was not overfitting. Should the model return a far lower RSE for the train data than the RMSE for test data, this means that the model parameters were only optimized for traiing data and thus overfit. However, this was not the case because the two values were comparable, as explored in the calculations previously mentioned. \n",

    "We found problematic amounts of multicollinearity in our final model with interactions being used for prediction. Due to the presence of problematic amounts of multicollinearity in our final model for prediction (VIF values greater than 10), we decided to use forward stepwise selection on just the predictor variables to get a model for inference. We ended up getting a subset of predictor variables in this new model that did not have problematic amounts of multicollinearity (highest VIF value was approximately 7). \n",

    "We explored if autocorrelation was present in our model since we were dealing with time of day. To set this up, we transformed the data into a data frame where each observation was the average price and number of rides for an hour in a day. We used the larger dataset for this analysis since it had complete information in terms of dates. Our analysis showed that there did not exist high correlations for various lags, so we determined autocorrelation was not a factor in our model. Additionally, accounting for autocorrelation wouldn’t make sense as our stakeholders don’t have information on how many rides took place in previous hours of previous days. Therefore, we did not take autocorrelation into account for the final model."

    "For the inference portion of our project, the inference technically holds for Boston rides, since the dataset only contains Boston rides data observations. However, should our stakeholders want to abstract our analysis on which predictor variables are relatively the most important predictors for ride price, we would need to redevelop our models with data from other cities with the same methods we used. However, to a large extent, the general trends will remain true regardless of the city, such that the overall importance of predictors for ride price can remain more or less useful in other major cities like Boston. Additionally, because this data was from 2018, the importance of predictors might be slightly outdated. However, from research knowing that distance and demand for rides impact the pricing algorithms on Uber/Lyft rides, we still see that this same relative importance of predictors will likely remain similar for rides today. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the prediction portion of our project, the stakeholder will be able to predict the outcome approximately one week out before the outcome occurs up until the actual ride takes place. Since we are using the type of ride, whether the ride was Uber/Lyft, and various weather variables to predict the price of a ride, this information will all become fairly accurate and available a week before one will take the ride (assuming that they have access to weather data through applications/websites that are usually accurate a week prior). If they have the information available about when they are preparing to take the ride and what type of ride they will take, then Uber and Lyft users are able to use our final model to predict what the price of their ride will likely be. Additionally, the same applies for Uber/Lyft drivers and taxi companies and drivers on predicting the likely price of Uber/Lyft rides with the given data. Further, we noted previously that since the data is for Boston rides only, the analysis may only be applicable for Boston (while possibly for other major cities), and the model can be redeveloped with new data for other cities, as well. It is also important to note that due to using a smaller weather dataset than rides dataset, when combined, we lost many data points. Our final data set had very limited data points for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Thus, our model may be less accurate for predicting prices on the weekends when demand could be different. However, if more data is collected and the same process of model creation is followed, predictions will become more accurate in the case that our limited weekend data is not representative of all rides on weekends. \n",

    "Based on our model, distance and product type are the most important factors that determine the price of a ride, while time of day, source/destination, and even weather had little impact. Additionally, our model can accurately predict the price of a ride in Boston with an RMSE of 2.69 USD. We recommned that Uber and Lyft riders should walk (if possible) to decrease ride distances and check both Uber and Lyft ride offerings to maximize savings. These would be more impactful than trying to plan a schedule of taking rides at certain times from certain places as those minimally impact ride price. For rideshare drivers, we recommend that they become drivers for both Uber and Lyft, so they can compare the prices of each at different times to maximize revenue. Finally, we recommend Taxi drivers who want to make competitive pricing can use our model to accurately predict the competition ride price to price lower and attract more customers with their better rates. This would be specifically useful to adjust their rates based on distance, as they could see how their prices for a ride of a certain distance compare to that of rideshare companies. One limitation of the model is that our data only considers rides in Boston for a 3 week period. Ride prices could fluctuate marginally in different places during different times of the year, resulting in a potential increase in the RMSE of our model. However, we can reasonably anticipate the general trends of our model to stay consistent regardless of urban area or time of year. This model would benefit from being updated yearly to account for inflation, however. A second limitation of the model is that it wasn't able to quite capture trends in demand for rides using weather, location, and time of day. From our personal experience, we know that demand surges can be hyper-localized: rideshare prices around a stadium/arena after a concert or sporting event tend to skyrocket for example. Surges like these are difficult to predict with a model as they require ultra-specific data about different locations at different times. It would be beneficial to the stakeholders if a model to predict this demand could be developed, but for now riders, drivers, and Taxi should be aware of events near their area and use their intuition regarding influences of demand.
