# Uber-Lyft-Ride-Price-Prediction
A Python project for final coursework in a Northwestern University STAT_303-2 Data Science in Python course. The project was completed in 2023 as part of a four-person team.

The project involved conducting an examination of data from Uber and Lyft prices and weather in the Boston, MA area from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices. Weather data and characteristics of rides were used as predictors to predict the projected price of a ride for Uber or Lyft using linear regression techniques, including lasso and ridge regression, to deliver conclusions to stakeholders.

Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Sklearn, and others, were utilized to identify relevant predictor variables and to build, tune, and use the necessary models.
